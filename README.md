Or.ca - Optimized Route Calculator Application
=====

A hackathon project from 2014. It was a themed hackathon, and the prompt for this project was - in essence if not in exact wording - to develop an app that would give a solution to the Salesman Problem. In that regard, it does not succeed fully, but it does organize waypoints to minimize total driving distance somewhat. And it looks fab ðŸ‘Œ.
